# Brief: wire-slash

**Round:** 16
**Mechanic verb:** CUT
**One line:** Enemy energy pulses travel along a glowing wire network — drag across wires to sever connections and reroute the flow into kill nodes before the pulses reach your core.

**Core feel:** Surgical. Tense. Like snipping the right wire in a bomb disposal scene. You see the pulses traveling in real time and you have to cut *ahead* of them.

**Background:** steel blue / slate — `#2E4E6A` (mid-tone, not dark)
**BPM:** 96, tense minimal electronic

**What makes it this game:** The network is visible. You can see exactly where every pulse is heading. The skill is reading the topology fast enough to cut the right wire before the pulse reaches the junction. Bad cuts reroute pulses *toward* your core instead of away.
